## SETTING
The **Iron Line** is the last functioning cross-country rail in a fractured steampunk America.  
Eldritch corruption ravages the land, making rail travel humanity’s only safe corridor.

### KEY LOCATIONS
- **Palo Alto Terminal:** Departure hub, tutorial zone, introduction to the researcher.
- **The Train:** Multi-car environment — engine, warded cargo car, passenger cars, armory, dining, and sleeper.
- **Stations (Checkpoints):** Used for refueling, shopping, and brief NPC interactions.
- **The Mawlands:** Corrupted wastelands between cities; source of most encounters.

### THE CARGO
A sealed box stored in its own warded car. Emits low-frequency hums and whispers.
The cult believes it contains the “Heart Below” — an Eldritch fragment capable of awakening gods.

### THE POCKET WATCH
A chronomantic device created to neutralize the cargo’s temporal corruption.
Upon the Marshall’s death, it reverses time to the start of the journey, preserving physical and mental progress.
