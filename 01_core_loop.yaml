## OVERVIEW
The entire game occurs during one continuous train journey.  
Every death rewinds time to the start, preserving the player’s growth.

### LOOP PHASES
1. **Departure:** Board train, speak with NPCs, inspect cargo.
2. **Travel:** Random events, enemy incursions, environmental hazards.
3. **Combat:** Fast, deliberate side-scrolling engagements.
4. **Death:** Pocket watch activates — time resets.
5. **Resurrection Sequence:**
   - Score screen tallies XP.
   - Level-up interface (flip-card animation).
   - Attribute and skill distribution.
6. **Restart Journey:** With improved stats, new narrative variations, and altered encounters.

### PLAYER GOAL
Survive all four in-game days of travel without dying once.  
Each successful “day” unlocks a permanent checkpoint for future runs.
