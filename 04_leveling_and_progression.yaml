## DEATH AND LEVEL-UP SEQUENCE
1. Player dies.  
2. Screen fades to black.  
3. Body collapses; watch activates.  
4. XP tally screen appears (flip-card UI).  
5. Player distributes new **Attribute Points**.  
6. Player selects new **Combat Skill** and/or **Field Skill**.  
7. Game rewinds to start or last unlocked checkpoint.

### EXPERIENCE SYSTEM
XP gained from:
- Defeating enemies
- Repairing train subsystems
- Completing side objectives
- Discovering secrets

### SKILL TYPES
- **Combat Skills:** active battle abilities (e.g., steam burst, counter parry, rifle flourish).
- **Field Skills:** passive or contextual (e.g., lockpicking, engineering, negotiation).

### PROGRESSION BALANCE
- Level-ups occur **only after death**.  
- Each loop shortens the time to mastery while increasing difficulty.  
- Story events evolve slightly after each loop.
