# Mission Summary (Lite)

A 16-bit side-scrolling action RPG set aboard a steampunk train carrying an eldritch artifact. Players must survive a four-day journey as a Train Marshall, but every death rewinds time via a chronomantic pocket watch—preserving levels, skills, and knowledge while resetting the journey. Master brutal, deliberate combat inspired by *Salt and Sanctuary*, learn enemy patterns and train layouts through repetition, and uncover narrative depth across multiple time loops. Victory means surviving all four days without dying once.
