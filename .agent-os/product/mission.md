# Product Mission

## Vision

Create a brutal, rewarding 16-bit side-scrolling action RPG that combines the deliberate combat of *Salt and Sanctuary* with the narrative depth of time-loop roguelikes. Set aboard a transcontinental steampunk train carrying a sealed eldritch artifact, players experience a four-day journey where death is both punishment and teacher.

## The Problem We're Solving

Modern action RPGs often sacrifice either mechanical depth for accessibility or narrative cohesion for replayability. Time-loop games can feel repetitive without meaningful progression, while roguelikes often lack strong narrative motivation for repeated runs.

## Our Solution

A tightly crafted side-scrolling action RPG where:
- **Death has meaning:** Each death rewinds time via a chronomantic pocket watch, preserving player growth (levels, skills, knowledge) while resetting the journey
- **Mastery through repetition:** Players learn enemy patterns, train layouts, NPC dialogues, and optimal strategies through multiple runs
- **Contained narrative:** The entire game takes place during one continuous train journey, making every location, character, and event narratively significant
- **Brutal but fair combat:** Real-time, stamina-based combat inspired by *Salt and Sanctuary* where timing, positioning, and resource management determine survival

## Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Fans of challenging 2D action games (*Hollow Knight*, *Salt and Sanctuary*, *Blasphemous*)
- Roguelike/roguelite enthusiasts who appreciate narrative depth (*Hades*, *Loop Hero*)
- Indie game players seeking unique settings and atmospheric storytelling

**Secondary:**
- Soulslike fans transitioning to 2D
- Players who enjoy steampunk and eldritch horror aesthetics
- Speedrunners (tight gameplay loop with optimization potential)

## Core Experience

Players embody a Train Marshall tasked with protecting an eldritch artifact during a four-day cross-country rail journey from Palo Alto, CA to Boston, MS. Cultists, corrupted creatures, and the artifact's influence itself threaten the mission. Each death activates a pocket watch that resets time to the journey's start—but the player retains experience, levels, and knowledge.

Victory means surviving all four days without dying. Each successful day unlocks a permanent checkpoint. The challenge escalates as players master the systems, with procedural variations in enemy encounters and evolving NPC dialogues based on loop count.

## Success Metrics

**Player Engagement:**
- Average session length: 45-90 minutes (typical run duration)
- Completion rate: Players reaching Day 4 at least once
- Loop count average: 15-25 runs to first full completion

**Quality Indicators:**
- Combat satisfaction: Tight controls, responsive feedback, fair difficulty
- Narrative engagement: Players discovering lore across multiple runs
- Replayability: Players continuing after first victory for secrets, speedruns, challenge runs

**Community Goals:**
- Positive reception in action/roguelike communities
- Speedrunning community adoption
- "Hidden gem" status among indie action RPG enthusiasts

## What Makes Us Different

1. **Setting:** Transcontinental steampunk train (claustrophobic, mobile, contained)
2. **Time Loop Justification:** Chronomantic pocket watch tied to cargo's temporal corruption (narrative-integrated mechanic)
3. **Progression Philosophy:** Death-gated leveling (XP accumulates, but levels only unlock after death)
4. **Combat Feel:** 16-bit aesthetic with modern soulslike weight and consequence
5. **Story Structure:** Single journey with branching variations rather than disconnected runs

## Long-term Vision

- Launch with core single-player experience
- Post-launch: Additional character classes, alternative routes/endings
- Community features: Shared ghost data, daily challenges, leaderboards
- Potential DLC: Alternate train routes, new artifact types, extended narrative
