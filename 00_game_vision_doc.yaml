# PROJECT: [Working Title TBD]
# =======================================

## HIGH CONCEPT
A 16-bit side-scrolling action RPG set aboard a transcontinental steampunk train carrying a sealed eldritch artifact.  
The player, a Train Marshall, must protect the cargo and survive a four-day journey from **Palo Alto, CA** to **Boston, MS**—but every death rewinds time to the start of the trip via a mysterious **pocket watch** that allows progression through repetition.

## CORE LOOP
Live. Die. Rebuild.  
Each run progresses the player's mastery, character level, and knowledge of the train and its passengers. The challenge: survive the entire four-day trip without dying.

## GENRE & STYLE
- 16-bit pixel art (SNES/Genesis aesthetic)
- Steampunk fantasy with whimsical tone and eldritch horror undertones
- Brutal real-time combat inspired by *Salt and Sanctuary*
- Mechanical foundation based on SRD 5.2-compatible stat and progression rules

## THEMES
- **Containment vs Corruption:** Humanity’s fragile attempt to cage the unknowable.  
- **Progress Through Failure:** Death and time loops are both punishment and learning tools.  
- **Faith in Machinery:** Technology and magic intertwine as desperate survival tools.  
- **Isolation in Motion:** A single train, a single mission, and time repeating endlessly.
