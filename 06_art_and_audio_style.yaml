## VISUAL STYLE
- **Era:** 16-bit SNES/Genesis.
- **Resolution:** 320x180 base (scaled).

- **UI:** Pocket-watch motif, riveted panels, brass dials.

## CHARACTER DESIGN
- Expressive pixel animation (2-4 frame idle loops, fluid attack frames).
- Distinct silhouettes per faction: polished brass military vs. ragged cultists.

## ENVIRONMENT
Each train car a distinct biome:
- Passenger car (warm lighting, chatter)
- Cargo car (runic wards, humming sigils)
- Dining car (elegant decay)
- Engine room (heat haze, glowing coals)

## AUDIO

- **Rhythm motif:** ticking watch, pulsing steam vents.
